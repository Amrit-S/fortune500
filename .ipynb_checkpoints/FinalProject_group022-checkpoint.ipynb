    "Several group members’ awareness of the substantially large homeless population in San Diego County spurred our interest in exploring the factors that influence homelessness. Our group is curious about why people become homeless and particularly, why California has such a large homeless population. Additionally, California is one of the major states that tech companies operate in and as a result the growth of tech companies seem to have an influence not only on the general population, but more concerningly, the homeless population. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our research, we found that a large proportion of the U.S. homeless population is in major cities in California (Statista) with almost 8,011 homeless individuals living in San Francisco alone (Sfgov.org). Additionally, San Francisco’s homeless population increased by 14% between 2017 and 2019 (SFgov.org), partially since more people resorted to living in their cars (Business Insider). This information reveals that there is a systemic issue that contributed to the growth of this population over the last few years. We also found that while the homeless population increased, tech companies in San Francisco rapidly expanded and their overall earnings increased with this growth (Business Insider). This highlights the growing wealth gap and how advancements in technology can affect the cost of living/homelessness in this region. After learning this information, we formulated a hypothesis that explores how financial growth of tech companies can be related to the rise of homelessness in San Francisco.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "A report done by Vox Media shows that not only the recent tech boom, but the limited and expensive housing prices have contributed to the growth in the homeless population in San Francisco (Vox). The recent tech boom in the city has attracted more wealthy and privileged individuals to San Francisco and as a result may have contributed to the rising rent prices. Also, the city’s poorly structured housing options (too expensive and limited housing) also limit housing to wealthier individuals and make it difficult for lower-income groups to easily find housing (Vox). Thus, the culmination of these two factors may have contributed to the rising homeless population as the city offers financial growth for individuals in more advancing fields and financial insecurity to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data analyzed to answer this question and hypothesis can clarify which factors have contributed to homelessness in the past few years. If we observe a relationship among the data sets we analyze, we could use this information to show the role that technological development may have in homelessness in San Francisco. This information could create an opportunity to eventually change harmful processes that favor the financial well being of some groups more than others. This could mean that cities like San Francisco can cater their efforts to create meaningful solutions to subdue the significant increase of homelessness in the past few years.\n",

    "Our question is indeed answerable since it can be analyzed via correlations between progress in technological advancements (percentages of industrialization)  and the corresponding increase/decrease in the homeless population in San Francisco (via percentages) over a certain period of time. With San Francisco being a major technological hub, especially Silicon Valley, for Apple and Google, information on technological advancement should be available. Moreover, since San Francisco is also one of the most populated cities in the United States, up-to-date records of the homeless situation should be readily available as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The information gathered from our project is intended to provide further clarity to the debate between technological advancement and its impact on employment. Specifically, technological progress is justified as providing more long term employment, and thereby less homeless rates by extension; however, the data gathered may instead illustrate the opposite - namely technological advancements lead to higher homelessness rates due to it weeding out lower skilled labor out of the workforce.  Considering that homelessness does often associate itself with victims with lower educational backgrounds, and therefore exist within a lower skilled labor force,  this may end up being the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledge that data and research regarding homeless individuals should be handled more cautiously as they are  vulnerable research subjects who may be influenced by certain factors. However, as we are not planning on gathering our own data and research, rather we are relying on pre-existing datasets, this should not be a concern for our project.  This argument can be further extended to the spheres of privacy and anonymization - both of which also do not concern our project for the aforementioned reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning and Deep Learning based models are more likely to bring problems with “black boxes”. For example, in the case of Facial Recognition projects for Deep Learning, they rely on the creation of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that “blindly” analyzes a set of data and tries to make connections. This would indeed make it hard for people to appeal the results of the model since Deep Learning holds little transparency due to its fundamental design. However, since our project is based on a research question, it holds itself to be relatively transparent and easy to appeal, as most analysis will be done through investigation of data sets. Accordingly, these data sets can be easily provided to the public. \n"
